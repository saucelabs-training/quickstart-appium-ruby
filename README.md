### Advice and Troubleshooting

There may be additional latency when using a remote webdriver to run tests on Sauce Labs, therefore timeouts or "Waits" may need to be increased. Please read the following wiki page on [tips regarding explicit waits](https://wiki.saucelabs.com/display/DOCS/Best+Practice%3A+Use+Explicit+Waits)
